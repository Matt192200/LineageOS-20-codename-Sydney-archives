# LineageOS 20 codename Sydney archives
Archives of the unofficial LineageOS 20 port for the Huawei Mate 20 Lite/codename Sydney

The goal of this archive is to preserve the work of a tiny group of dev that made this ROM.
Lately, one of the devs noticed that he wasnt seeing any support and that if it goes on like this, 
then he might stop the developpement of the ROM, which would be a bummer. This archive is an emergency archive
in case something bad happens to the project and also to recover old versions of the project since
the devs have been replacing old versions with new one, meaning that they dont leave the old ones
for download anymore. Luckily, as a mistake, i kept them and forgot to delete them, which turned
out to be a great choice. If you wanna support the devs, the links are down below, give them as much
support as you can, because we never know.
